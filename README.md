# Project Setup

## API Key Configuration

**Important:** This project requires your own API key to function properly.

### Steps:
1. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder
2. Add your API key to the `.env` file

Example `.env` file format:
```
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

---

**Note:** Make sure to never commit your `.env` file to version control. Add it to `.gitignore` to keep your API key secure.
